# Key Responsibilities of the Application Layer

The main job of the application layer is to enable end-users to access the Internet via a number of applications. This involves:

- **Writing data off to the network** in a format that is compliant with the protocol in use.

- **Reading data** from the end-user.

- **Providing useful applications** to end users.

- Some applications also ensure that the data from the end-user is in the correct format.

- Error handling and recovery is also done by some applications.

## The Post Analogy

- Imagine you post a package across the world.

- Presumably, the post system would hand it off to an airplane or ship to transport it across the world.

- However, you would take it to the post office first to be shipped off. **Carrying the package to the post office** is what the application layer does in networks, except that **it carries messages to the transport layer!**

# Where It Exists

The application layer resides entirely on end-systems. These end-systems can be any Internet-enabled device, be it a refrigerator or a tower PC.

# Application Layer Protocols

Most would argue that **user applications are the true purpose of the Internet. If useful applications did not exist,** the Internet would not be what it is today.

- The development of the Internet in the last century started with text-based network apps such as **e-mail.**

- Then came **the** app: the **World Wide Web** which revolutionized everything.

- **Instant messaging** came at the end of the millennium, which has changed the way we communicate.

- Since then, we have come up with **voice over IP,** (WhatsApp calls), **video chat** (Skype), and **video streaming** (YouTube).

- **Social media** has also taken the world by storm resulting in complex human social networks and businesses building on top of these websites.

All of these applications **run on application layer protocols.** Due to the presence of these standard protocols, client applications developed by various vendors can talk to server applications developed by others!
